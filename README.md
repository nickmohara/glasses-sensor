`metawear-and-tv.py` is used for the TV device and `metawear-and-driving.py` is used for the texting and driving device. The only difference is the driving script only actuates when looking down while the TV actuates when you look down and look back up (to pause and then resume play). The texting and driving script is also more sensitive.
